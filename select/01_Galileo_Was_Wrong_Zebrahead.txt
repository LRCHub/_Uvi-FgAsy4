You're always running and
You're gunning for a piece of the pie
A super spy
So conniving with your eye on the sly
You're pulse slowin' ego growing as
Your picking up pace
Heard ya burned all your bridges
Now you lose the race
So smash it up nothing left to prove
These strange days are all about you
Smash it up you can't get through
The world does not revolve around you
(revolve around you, revolve around you)
The world does not revolve around you
'Cause this will be the last time
That you ever mess with me
You want everything for nothing
But nothing is a something
And nothing here is free
'Cause this will be the last time
That you ever mess with me
You want everything for nothing
But nothing is a something
And nothing here is nothing here is free
A major thrashing as you're crashing
No one left to obey
A killer angle try to strangle
Anything in your way
Self preservation on the station
Rocks your radio
A one-two knock out, you're a TKO
So smash it up nothing left to lose
These strange days are all about you
Smash it up no matter what you do
The world does not revolve around you
(revolve around you, revolve around you)
The world does not revolve around you
'Cause this will be the last time
That you ever mess with me
You want everything for nothing
But nothing is a something
And nothing here is free
'Cause this will be the last time
That you ever mess with me
You want everything for nothing
But nothing is a something
And nothing here is nothing here is free
The world's not enough
Ya still like it rough more ego than tough
I'm calling your bluff the bass drum erupts
Your blood pressure drops strictly corrupt
'Till Karma goes "what's up?"
Smash it up i wanna lie to you
These strange days are all about you
Smash it up leave me black and blue
One day, your world will dissolve around you
(dissolve around you, dissolve around you)
One day, your world will dissolve around you
'Cause this will be the last time
That you ever mess with me
You want everything for nothing
But nothing is a something
And nothing here is free
'Cause this will be the last time
That you ever mess with me
You want everything for nothing
But nothing is a something
And nothing here is nothing here is free
Smash it up you can't get through
These strange days are all about you
Smash it up nothing left to prove
The world does not revolve around you
